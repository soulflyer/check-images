# check-images

Check that all the images in an image collection are present in a given directory. In the default case, images are expected to be present in 4 directories, thumbs, medium, large and fullsize. Older exports did not use all 4 of these, and this program can identify missing images so they can be re-exported. Also potentially useful if other sizes are added in the future.
